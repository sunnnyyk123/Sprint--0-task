| 1        | What is the difference between a Shared Library and a Jenkinsfile? | A Jenkinsfile is specific to a single project and defines its CI/CD pipeline. A Shared Library is a central place to store reusable pipeline code for multiple projects.                          |
| 2        | Where should I define the Shared Library in Jenkins?               | Shared Libraries can be configured in Jenkins by navigating to: `Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Global Pipeline Libraries`. Alternatively, use the `@Library` annotation in the Jenkinsfile. |
| 3        | Can I use version control with Shared Libraries?                   | Yes. You can manage Shared Libraries using Git. You can reference specific branches or tags using `@Library('lib-name@version')`.                                                                 |
| 4        | What language is used to write Shared Libraries?                   | Shared Libraries are written in **Groovy**, which is the scripting language used by Jenkins pipelines.                                                                                            |
| 5        | What’s the difference between `vars` and `src` directories?        | The `vars` directory contains simple reusable scripts or functions accessible like global methods. The `src` directory contains structured Groovy classes for complex logic and OOP.              |
| 6        | How do I load a Shared Library in my Jenkinsfile?                  | You load a library using: `@Library('library-name@version') _` at the top of your Jenkinsfile. This imports the functions/classes defined in the library.                                         |
